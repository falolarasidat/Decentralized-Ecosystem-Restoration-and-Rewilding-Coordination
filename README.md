# Decentralized Ecosystem Restoration and Rewilding Coordination Platform

A comprehensive blockchain-based platform for coordinating global ecosystem restoration efforts through smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This platform consists of five interconnected smart contracts that manage different aspects of ecosystem restoration:

1. **Species Reintroduction Management** - Coordinates safe return of extinct species through de-extinction technology
2. **Habitat Corridor Creation** - Connects fragmented ecosystems to enable wildlife migration and genetic diversity
3. **Soil Microbiome Restoration** - Rebuilds healthy soil ecosystems damaged by industrial agriculture
4. **Pollinator Network Rehabilitation** - Restores bee, butterfly, and other pollinator populations globally
5. **Mycorrhizal Network Enhancement** - Strengthens underground fungal networks that support forest health

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Species Reintroduction Management (\`species-reintroduction.clar\`)

Manages the complex process of reintroducing species to their native habitats:

- **Species Registration**: Register extinct or endangered species for reintroduction programs
- **Genetic Diversity Tracking**: Monitor genetic health and diversity of reintroduced populations
- **Release Coordination**: Coordinate timing and location of species releases
- **Population Monitoring**: Track success rates and population growth
- **Stakeholder Management**: Manage permissions for researchers, conservationists, and local authorities

### 2. Habitat Corridor Creation (\`habitat-corridors.clar\`)

Facilitates the creation of wildlife corridors connecting fragmented ecosystems:

- **Corridor Planning**: Register and plan new habitat corridors
- **Land Acquisition**: Coordinate land purchases or agreements for corridor creation
- **Construction Management**: Track corridor construction progress and milestones
- **Connectivity Metrics**: Measure ecosystem connectivity improvements
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Coordinate ongoing corridor maintenance

### 3. Soil Microbiome Restoration (\`soil-restoration.clar\`)

Manages soil health restoration projects:

- **Soil Assessment**: Record soil health metrics and microbiome diversity
- **Treatment Planning**: Plan and coordinate soil restoration treatments
- **Microbial Inoculation**: Track beneficial microorganism introductions
- **Progress Monitoring**: Monitor soil health improvements over time
- **Farmer Incentives**: Manage rewards for participating farmers and landowners

### 4. Pollinator Network Rehabilitation (\`pollinator-network.clar\`)

Coordinates global pollinator population restoration:

- **Pollinator Species Management**: Track different pollinator species and their populations
- **Habitat Creation**: Coordinate creation of pollinator-friendly habitats
- **Migration Tracking**: Monitor pollinator migration patterns and routes
- **Colony Health**: Track hive and colony health metrics
- **Pesticide Impact**: Monitor and mitigate pesticide impacts on pollinators

### 5. Mycorrhizal Network Enhancement (\`mycorrhizal-network.clar\`)

Strengthens underground fungal networks supporting forest ecosystems:

- **Network Mapping**: Map existing mycorrhizal networks in forest ecosystems
- **Fungal Inoculation**: Coordinate introduction of beneficial fungi
- **Tree Health Monitoring**: Track forest health improvements
- **Carbon Sequestration**: Monitor carbon storage improvements
- **Research Coordination**: Facilitate research on mycorrhizal benefits
